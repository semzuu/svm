# SVM (Small Virtual Machine)
Attempting to make a VM with a basic assembler.\
This project is only for learning purposes.

### TODO
[X] Basic implementation\
[X] Stack (PUSH / POP)\
[X] Algorithmic instruction set (ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, MOD)\
[X] Reading and writing files\
[X] Expanding instruction set (JMP, CMP, HLT, DUP, SWP)\
[X] Lexer for basic assembler\
[ ] Logical instruction set (AND, OR, XOR, SHL, SHR, ROL, ROR)\
[ ] Data types (INT, FLOAT, CHAR, STRING?)\
[ ] Adding labels and call stack(JMP to labels, RET)\
[ ] Variables (SET)\
[ ] I/O (READ, WRITE)\
[ ] Registers (IP, BP, SP, 4 regular-use registers)\
[ ] Basic memory
